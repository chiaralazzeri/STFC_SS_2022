    "### Installing Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages are installed using ```conda``` or ```pip```. \n",
    "\n",
    "When installing packages it is best to install packages at once, so that all of the dependencies are installed at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Conda?\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda is Anaconda's built in package manager. Conda install's packages from the official [Anacond Package Repository](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/repo).\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "More on [installing and managing packages with conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html) and the conda [cheat sheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/cheatsheet.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Pip?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pip is a simple command-line package manager Python. It can be installed with ```conda``` and provides users with access to all packaged published on the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "More on [using Pip in a Conda Environment](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/using-pip-in-a-conda-environment).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conda vs Pip\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest difference between Conda and Pip is how they handle dependeicies amongst packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pip does not check to ensure that all the dependencies of all packages are fulfilled simultaneously. If the package installed earlier in order have incompatible dependencies with versions relative to the packages installed later in that order, the environment is broken. These dependecy issues can remain undetected until you find some strange errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda solves this using a satisfiability (SAT) which verifies that all dependencies are met. The downside to this is that installs can take extra time (this is why you should install packages all at once).\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally conda should be your first check for packages and then Pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two other major differences are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. conda allows you to create a named and isolated copy of Python, called environments, where can work with specefic versions of Ptyhon and packages without affecting your base installation. These enviroments make it easy to; seperate projects which can rely on both specfic versions of Python and packages (like numpy); to test, install, and develop new packages without breaking your base installation; and collaborate with others providing a simple way to share/mirror environments.\n",
    "1. There is never a need to compile conda packages and conda packages are not limited to Python software (pip is), they can contain librariers in other languages and even execultbles (like compilers or the Python interpreter).\n",

    "### Importing Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages are imported using ```import package-name```, once imported you can use all functionality of that package.\n",
